                <p>
                    For the past six years data has been a big part of my life. And not just in the sense that <a href="https://medium.com/@dennybritz/data-is-eating-the-software-world-d160db086bd3">data is eating the world</a>.  Data has been my livelihood.  It’s what I’m thinking about in the shower or on walks with my daughter.  It’s what I wade through, organize, investigate, and transform every workday.  I wouldn’t have it any other way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wasn’t supposed to be a technologist.  I thought I was supposed to be a fancy lawyer.  Or at least, that was my thinking for the early part of my adult life.  I spent four years earning a degree in English from UMass Amherst, immediately followed by three years of law school at William & Mary.  I got my very nice-looking diplomas framed and started my very short law career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had two problems:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Contrary to various advertising materials I may have read, having a law degree from a prestigious school doesn’t result in law firms throwing money at you willy-nilly (at least it didn’t in the depths of the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp">Great Recession</a>).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I didn’t find the practice of law particularly interesting.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I got myself a law job that didn’t pay particularly well and that I didn’t particularly like.  But something great happened at that job.  My boss asked if anyone on the team wanted to work on an “Excel project” for a bit and I volunteered.  That data task led to more data tasks, until I was doing data analytics full-time.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The easy path for me would have been to stick with my career in law.  I’d already spent three years of school, a grueling bar exam, and three years in the industry when I decided that my professional future was in data.  And there is no doubt it has been challenging switching careers.  It’s involved a lot of dedication both in work and outside of it.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    My starting point was a single college course, <i>Introduction to Programming in C</i>, which I did not expect to ever use in my career.  But once I had my mind made up about what I wanted to do I set out to keep leveling myself up: learning Excel, then SQL, then Python, then JavaScript.  This is one of the things that attracts me the most to my field, the continued opportunity to learn and improve.  I continue to be embarrassed when I review work that I did a year or two ago.  I just have to remind myself it would be more embarrassing if I looked over old work and didn’t see ways to improve it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s not to say my training in English and law were a waste of time.  I count my ability to clearly communicate with my colleagues as one of my best assets, and one that I find is sometimes missing in otherwise fantastic engineers.  Analytical thinking is also a big part of Law School training, and it’s surprising how much of that skill set transfers over to thinking about coding challenges.  When I was in law school they called it <a href="https://lawschooltoolbox.com/value-issue-spotting-strategies-improve-skills/">issue spotting</a>, but now when I’m coding it’s called debugging.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m grateful that I get to work in a field that I’m passionate about.  That I get to continue to learn and grow and be challenged in my career.
